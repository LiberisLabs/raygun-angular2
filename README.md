# Raygun for Angular 2

A pre-packaged Angular 2 addon that attempts to take the hard work
out of logging errors with Raygun. Still very much in beta but
logs plenty of information already.

# Installation
From within an Angular2 project

  - `npm install raygun-angular2 --save`
  - `typings install npm:raygun-angular2 --save`
  
If you are using a similar setup to the Angular2 Quickstart (i.e., using SystemJS)
add the following to your `System.config`:

```js
      System.config({
        packages: {
          'raygun-angular2': {
              main: 'index.js',
              defaultExtension: 'js'
          },
          'stack-trace': {
              main: 'stack-trace.js',
              defaultExtension: 'js'
          }
        },
        paths: {
            'raygun-angular2': 'node_modules/raygun-angular2/',
            'stack-trace': 'node_modules/stack-trace/lib/'
        }
      });
```

# Usage
raygun-angular2 has a dependency on `@angular/http` so ensure that
the bundle is loaded and the provider is bootstrapped in to your
application

```js
import {bootstrap} from '@angular/platform-browser';
import {provide, ExceptionHandler} from '@angular/core';
import {HTTP_PROVIDERS} from '@angular/http';
import {RaygunExceptionHandler} from 'raygun-angular2';
import {AppComponent} from './appComponent';
import {ROUTER_PROVIDERS} from '@angular/router';

RaygunExceptionHandler.apiKey = 'Enter API Key here';

bootstrap(AppComponent, [
  ROUTER_PROVIDERS,
  HTTP_PROVIDERS,
  provide(ExceptionHandler, {useClass: RaygunExceptionHandler})
]);
```

### Development Environments

To prevent errors being reported to Raygun during development 
use `setDevelopmentHostnames` to blacklist your local hostnames.

```js
RaygunExceptionHandler.setDevelopmentHostnames(['localhost']);
```

# Still To Do

- Provide public method to set user
- Fill in gaps in collected information
- Use `X-ApiKey` headers rather than a query string, however
  Raygun currently does not correctly respond to the pre-flight
  request generated by Angular2.
